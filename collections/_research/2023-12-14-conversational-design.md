### 4 Dimensions of Tone of Voice

A product's tone of voice communicates how an organization feels about its message. The tone of any piece of content can be analyzed along 4 dimensions: humor, formality, respectfulness, and enthusiasm.

![Think of each of the four dimensions as a spectrum -- a piece of copy could fall at any point along the line.](https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2023/08/02/tone-of-voice-poster-article-visual_15-1.jpg)

### Tone spectrum

The right tone depends on a user‚Äôs contextual needs and corresponding emotions for that experience, as well as how involved and emotional we need to be in the process.
