summary: Secure, Powerful Crypto Wallet & Chat App for Individuals, Businesses, Everyone and Individuals.
project-date: 2022-12-09
challenges:
- Onboarding and Usability. For many users, Web3 applications, including crypto messaging apps, are complex due to concepts like wallets, keys, and tokens. The onboarding process can be intimidating for non-technical users. Web3 applications require users to manage wallets, private keys, and digital assets, which can be daunting for users not familiar with these concepts.
- Decentralized Identity (DID) Integration. The decentralized nature of Web3 means users don’t rely on centralized login systems (like Google or Facebook). Instead, decentralized identity solutions require handling cryptographic identities, which can be cumbersome.

roles:
- Head of Product
- Researcher

### Solutions

Ready is a new-generation messaging application with a crypto wallet and DApp browser integrated. ONLY a wallet address (previously generated elsewhere or newly created using Ready) is needed to register and authenticate a Ready account. Ready users do not need to provide their phone number or any other personal information; thus, they can have more security and better privacy within a seamless experience. 

This white paper describes both [the product](https://ready.io/whitepaper/product-026aed46b4eb448cbc94ac0bf7f07560) and [the token](https://ready.io/whitepaper/token-5631222ac17f4bd88052fed833edd623). Ready offers communication flexibility (1-1 chat, group chat, channel), efficient crypto asset management (wallet, trade via messages, swap, dashboard), DApp browsing, multiple account login, and assistant chatbots. 

The Ready token (RDY) is the utility and governance token for the Ready ecosystem. The issuance of RDY supports the user-centric incentive structure that we design to benefit all participants. This includes the anti-spam filter, membership in groups and channels, sticker market, governance, and more to come.
