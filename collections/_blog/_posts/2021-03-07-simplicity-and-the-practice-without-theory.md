### What is the simplicity

My two favorite quotes by **Leonardo Da Vinci**: 
> Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.

and,

> He who loves practice without theory is like the sailor who boards a ship without a rudder and compass and never knows where he may be cast.

When I am thinking about simplicity, I always associate it with complication.

A pretty good quote mentioned in [this article](https://spiderum.com/bai-dang/Suy-nghi-don-gian-khong-giup-cuoc-song-cua-ban-don-gian-8w0) that I liked.

> “Life is difficult. This is a great truth, one of the greatest truths. It is a great truth because once we truly see this truth, we transcend it. Once we truly know that life is difficult-once we truly understand and accept it-then life is no longer difficult. Because once it is accepted, the fact that life is difficult no longer matters.”
> 
> ― M. Scott Peck, The Road Less Traveled: A New Psychology of Love, Traditional Values and Spiritual Growth

When you have experienced and understood, the mastery of understanding the nature of an object leads to simplicity. That means, when we explain the nature of objects carefully, we can see that it is simple, instead of simplifying the problem yourself to avoid the difficulties- get the adapted approach yourself.

### Practice-Based Learning

I am not saying to learn the theory and then go to work, but we should use the knowledge and experience of our predecessors imparted to us.

I want to say less and do more, sharing my experiences and exploration with everyone. That's a way to save my time and validate my ideas when designing. However, how to make them easy to understand for the ones who do not like theory much 😅. That’s a big deal and also is my mission in the design challenge.
