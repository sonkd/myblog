I published an article about digital Social identity experience [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/personal-social-identity-why-you-should-own-blockchain-kim-dinh-son){:target="_blank"}. Here are my conclusions:

```
An online communication platform (Community Online) needs user identification to serve the management and response of online utilities. In addition, the challenges that the platform for Online Communities needs to meet to help users stay close and trusted with relatives or friends, safety when communicating with strangers, simplifying the experience in using and managing your online identity, and a personal show-off to stand out in the online community. Using Wallet ID helps prevent catfishing profiles on Community Online and simplifies all identity verification issues, safety, and convenience.
```

## The key problems that need to solve

#### How can you be close and trustworthy with acquaintances/friends?
- I want people to remember my name easily.
- My name is authenticated so as not to be confused with others.

#### How do you be safe when communicating with strangers?
- I want to remain anonymous and not reveal all personal information; they cannot know who I am and what I look like, and my style and preferences must be kept confidential.

#### How might we simplify account usage with less management effort and identification of concerns with online platforms?
I want to pay for convenient transactions like Apple Pay, Xbox Points, or a credit card.
Users want to use the same username across multiple devices trustless.

#### How do you show me to the community so people quickly know me?
- I want to make an impression.
- I want to make it simple and easy to remember.

## Trending of Digital Social Identity
With the current development trend, every user will own a crypto wallet in the future. Nowadays, Trust contacts are the primary solution for every web3 platform/Dapps.
- *Chat name* (Display name): The default for all Ready users instead of displaying the chat key is long and challenging to read; the user must make much effort to check when trying to authenticate a message for a new contact. It is necessary to propose a form of chat name that is easy to read and check and still ensures uniqueness. For example, display a Random name with three letters instead of the chat key.
- *Nickname*: The user can give a nickname to any user in the contact to easily remember and identify that contact. If that contact has not been nicknamed, it is displayed with a Random name.
- *Short name*: a more “human-readable name” and accessible, especially high authenticity because a reputable third-party service provides it. ENS name offers a solution for the chat key when chat will replace a Random name to display to others, so other people can easily search for a user relying on ENS name services unless they choose to hide from search.
