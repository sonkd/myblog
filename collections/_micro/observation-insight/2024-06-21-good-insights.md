We can't judge whether an insight is right or wrong (cause it's a piece of information), but we always expect it to be good enough to be actionable and relevant. From my experience and perspective when working with colleagues, a good insight has some signals: it illustrates some things new âœ¨ and touches on the root cause of the problem.

When observing to collect the raw customer data, we should keep an open-ended approach, avoid bias, and do anything that can impact "real" data from the customer's view. Good observations lead to good insights.
