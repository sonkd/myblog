I shared my thought about my career at [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/three-key-factors-help-sustain-journey-towards-your-dream-son/?trackingId=3lvB4RbW0cA3kgzo9KxD0Q%3D%3D).

A dream in your life: You are unique in this world, and you have your own dream. You cannot walk in someone else's path. It would be best if you started with your dream crazy enough to grow yourself.

Take the opportunities and try it on my road.
