Plato believed that what we perceive through our senses is just a shadow of true reality. In his famous Allegory of the Cave, he argued that we live in a world of illusions, and only through reason can we access the “Forms”—eternal truths that lie beyond what we see. Similarly, in Buddhism, the “Three Wise Monkeys” teach mindfulness and ethical conduct, encouraging us to be mindful instead of what we see 🙈 , hear 🙉, and say 🙊.
