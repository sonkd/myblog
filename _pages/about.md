Hi 👋, my name is Kevin Kim, and I have been a Product designer in the *gaming*, *IT software services*, and *digital banking industry* since 2016.


As [a practitioner of the Design Thinking method](https://www.credly.com/badges/d7ba6db5-ff1a-42e8-b854-ae6d3e8028a8){:target="_blank"}, my tagline is to pursue minimalism to understand myself and people deeply from intrinsic. The innovation outcomes always come from a simple foundation.

> _"If I had an hour to solve a problem, I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions"_--Albert Einstein.

**My dream and career**

In high school, I was fascinated by the beauty of elementary math, especially Geometry and Combinatorics, and dreamed of becoming a mathematician. Later, I majored in computer science at university, aspiring to create great products like Facebook, Google, or Apple 🫠.

I began my career as a mobile app game designer for three years, where I developed skills in **user experience** and customer psychology. This sparked my curiosity to explore further. My favorite book, ["On the Way to Fun](https://www.amazon.com/Way-Fun-Emotion-Based-Approach-Successful/dp/1568815824){:target="_blank"}: An Emotion-Based Approach to Successful Game Design", taught me the key difference between buying and creating: to build with passion and mind, and to craft with skills and tools.

In recent years, I have worked in the field of Digital Product Design in the finance/banking industry and consulted for several blockchain projects. This has given me a broad view of financial systems, from micro to macro, and how various factors influence decisions at individual, group, and national levels. It's too BIG 😂. Now, I'm studying psychology behavior to understand how customers buy and make decisions. My most interested topic is [Bias in Product Design](/research/2023-12-13-bias).

I still dreamed of my dream when I was a kid-an artist 🧑‍🎨. That can help me answer *"Who am I?"* question.

**Build my blog**

I'd like to share and archive my knowledge of design in life and what I have observed and been enlightened about. I write more to reflect and improve myself about my experiences, perceptions, and discovered things.

**Music for life**

My most fav track is ♫ ["Fix you"](https://open.spotify.com/track/7LVHVU3tWfcxj5aiPFEW4Q?si=bb571cb38d7b4565"){:target="_blank"} by Coldplay.

My musical flavor leans a bit toward the alternative rock genre of Coldplay, The Killers, or Imagine Dragons. The music has an electronic touch with vibrant themes while still feeling the depth of the soul. I also like some Vietnamese traditional songs.
